#BolCorr_Magnitudes

This repository holds code I wrote for calculating updated Bolometric Corrections to be implemented into the Supernova Explosion Code (SNEC, https://stellarcollapse.org/index.php/SNEC.html) for the set of wavebands ugriz, UBVRI, GALEX NUV/FUV, and SWIFT bands M2, W1, W2 as well as code to, using these corrections, calculate magnitudes over time given bolometric luminosity, temperature, and radius information from simulations of core-collapse supernovae, both including and not including the effects of light travel time delay.
