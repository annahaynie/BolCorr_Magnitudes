#RSG-CSM

This repository holds code used for calculating updated Bolometric Corrections for the set of wavebands ugriz, UBVRI, GALEX NUV/FUV, and SWIFT bands M2, W1, W2 as well as code to implement these corrections to calculate magnitudes over time given bolometric luminosity, temperature, and radius information from simulations of core-collapse supernovae in SNEC (https://stellarcollapse.org/index.php/SNEC.html), both including and not including the effects of light travel time delay.
